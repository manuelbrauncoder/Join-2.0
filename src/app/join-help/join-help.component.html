    <h2>What is Join?</h2><br />
    <p><span class="color-lb">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by
        a
        group of
        dedicated students as
        part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.
        <br>
        <br>
        Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work, limit
        work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). <span class="color-lb">Join</span> leverages
        the principles of
        kanban to help
        users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.
        <br>
        <br>
        It is important to note that <span class="color-lb">Join</span> is designed as an educational

        extensive business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible user experience, we cannot

    <h2>How to use it</h2><br />
    <p>Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use <span class="color-lb">Join</span></p><br>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h4>Exploring the Board</h4>
            <p>When you log in to <span class="color-lb">Join</span>, you'll find a default board. This board
                represents
                your project and
                contains four default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and "Done".</p><br>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Creating Contacts</h4>
            <p>In <span class="color-lb">Join</span>, you can add contacts to collaborate on your projects. Go
                to the
                "Contacts" section,
                click on "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once added, these contacts can
                be assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on the board.</p><br>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Adding Cards</h4>
            <p>Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards. Cards
                represent individual
                tasks. Click the "+" button under the appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the
                task details in the card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.</p><br>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Moving Cards</h4>
            <p>As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on the board
                by dragging
                and dropping the card from one list to another.</p><br>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h4>Deleting Cards</h4>
            <p>Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list or delete
                it. Deleting a
                card will permanently remove it from the board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards,
                as
                this action is irreversible.
                Remember that using <span class="color-lb">Join</span> effectively requires consistent
                updates from you and
                your team to
                ensure the board reflects the current state of your project. Have more questions about
